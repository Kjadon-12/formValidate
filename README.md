# formValidate

##It is frontend part where we will get data(countryList , stateList , cityList) from MongoDB and storing user Details to Database(MongoDB)
Task === In this i've to implement a form which take 

firstName,lastName(only alphabets) email, dob , age, gender(radio type) and countrylist and according to selected countrylist display 
state and according to selected state showing city..


but in this code there is some bug, i am sending  countryCode and stateCode to cityAction but it was showing undefined in backend(api)

So i'll work on that to resolve that error,,,so for now if you want to see the woking of this code then please make a change in userForm.jsx file at line 110 comment out that line so formValidation will not happen otherwise it can give error because rigth now we have not completed the functionality of getting cityList,,,

But Backend Part of this code is fine means all api(s) working fine (checked on postman).
